# Fractal-Systems-Project

This repository is meant to store codes related to a scientific project of mine, in which I'll study the fractal properties of various systems. Please read this full file before doing anything with this repo.

- Pre-requisites: I made everything here in python 3 (specifically 3.8.2). The file "modules.txt" includes a list of all the premade modules and libraries that I used to produce all of the codes here, so take a look at it and update/install everything you don't have installed to guarantee that everything is going to work properly;

- The zen of python: Tim Peters, one of the great collaborators to contribute to python's creation, summarized what he thinks makes a good python coder and called these principles "The zen of python", you can check out his words in the following link: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/. I try to always follow this philosophy, python is inefficient when it comes to processing, but very efficient with regards to the coding process and mainly when it comes to understanding a code. Making simple, elegant, organized and well commented codes helps you understand a project long forgotten as well as others understand your own code, and since python has already become a language well known and shared around the world, it is important to create readable and understandable codes for any possible collaborator, so, especially if you plan to use this repo, I recommend you try to follow this philosophy as well as possible;

- References: The folder "References" includes a few references to some of the methods and algorithms used in the codes, so if there is an algorithm you want to understand properly, you can take a look at this folder and look for the reference for a better understanding, some of the references will simply be links of the articles/books I used, some will be simplified PDF files produced by me, in case I think some reference is unnecessarily complicated;

- Git etiquette: This repository is very important to me since it compiles a lot of work of a very important project of mine, so much so that I made it private, but I'm willing to share it with whoever can contribute with me, so for those who have access to this repository, I ask you to follow basic git etiquette. Never work on the master branch, always create a separate branch and be sure to use names that are intuitive for anyone to understand what that branch is about, or create your own brach with your name and give a clear description of every commit you make. Never request a merge before testing the changes you made and being at least confident about what you did (I'll not ask for 100% certainty because any coder knows absolute certainty in a code is very utopic).

If I shared this work with you, it means I'm looking forward to see what good things you have to add to this repo, so please be sure to follow the rules and let's make a great work!
